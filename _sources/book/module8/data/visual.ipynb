Our flight from London arrived late due to the Pakistan airspace restrictions and although we were met by a lady from Bangkok Airways and rushed across the airport we did not make the connection as the lady was not able to use any pressure to expedite the delay at transit immigration at security. However Bangkok Airways did get us on the later flight and the 4 hours in their lounge at BKK was ok! Once on board the A320 was quite tired and the seat cushions past their best. The flight arrived on time and they managed to serve a hot drink and a pastry in the 1 hour duration. In spite of the missed connection our luggage arrived on the flight so this was good!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

She's a true dedicated employee. I was booked from Krabi to Bkk & connecting SQ979 to S'pore on April 5th, I realized on the day before my departure, Bangkok Airways was grounded and not taking off to Bkk and I went directly to KBV Airport on April 5th early morning hoping to book a ThaiSmile flight to BKK which was departing at 4pm that same April 5th. Somehow, with sheer luck I managed to get a seat with the kind help of Guy knowing that ThaiSmile was also fully booked and that I'm on their 1st priority list. At the same time,  Guy also made sure that I'm checked in with ThaiSmile as I need to be in Bangkok to connect my SQ flight back home to S'pore. Simultaneously she also made arrangements for Bangkok Airways Staff at Suvarnabhumi Airport to assist me for check-in with SIA knowing that it was a time-factor that I needed to check-in ASAP as my SQ Departure time was 6.30pm & ThaiSmile arrival Bkk at 5.30pm as I had to clear Customs & Immigration that will consume some time. Overall I made it for my SQ-979 check-in on time with the help of Bangkok Airways Staff at Suvarnabhumi Airport.    1\n",

Easy Check-In, The Bangkok Lounge (available to everyone) was crowded but still comfortable and the food and refreshments options plus WiFi are a bonus. Boarded on time via a bus, but was organized and efficient. Plane left bang on time and flight was 50 mins, in this time 4 crew still managed to serve a small hot lunch with hot beverages.

Soft drinks and snacks were provided in the lounge and staff were very helpful. When it came time for boarding Yudi also escorted me to the aircraft. Thank you Yudi, much appreciated. The flight itself was an overnight flight and was quite full, however the cabin crew managed to serve a meal and soft drinks and overall, they were very helpful and engaging in the typical warm and friendly Garuda-Indonesia way. We arrived in Sorong on time, and it took approx. 15 minutes for my baggage to come out, considering that early morning in Soring is very busy as many airlines arrive with 30 minutes of each other I found this a very acceptable time to wait.

The Boarding process was controlled and the cabin crew gave a very warm welcome upon boarding. We pulled back from the gate on schedule, however we had a long taxi to the runway, however that did not impact the arrival time in Sorong. Once airborne the cabin crew offered a selection of meals, however I opted for a sandwich. Prior to landing in the cabin crew again offered snacks and warm and cold drinks. Baggage was delivered very promptly i.e. approx. 5 minutes after arrival.
